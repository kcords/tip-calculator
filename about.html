      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>This application was designed to provide a simple solution to the question of "How much is appropriate to tip?"</p>
      <p>I have extracted recommended tipping values from reputable sources and consolidated them into pre-assigned tip
        percentages based on the quality of the service received.</p>
      <p>You also have the ability to round the total amount to either the nearest dollar or quarter for cleaner record
        keeping.</p>
      <p>Whether you're dining out or ordering takeout, this application will help you determine an appropriate tip amount
        with ease.</p>
      <p>Thank you for using the application and feel free to let me know if you have any ideas or suggestions for new
        features.</p>
